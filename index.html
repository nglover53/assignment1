            Welcome to my page! Here, you will find a small body of my work and interests.  
            I have a non-traditional educational path. I worked as a restaurant and bar manager for 5 years. Some of those years I worked with famous chefs like Chef Kevin Tien.  
            I decided to return to school during the pandemic.  In my time at Georgia Tech, I have become interested in AI safety, and other issues of computational ethics such as algorithmic 
            discrimination.  I remain closely tied to the restaurant industry, and my working class peers. I care very much about the impact of tech on marginalized communities. My mission 
            is to educate others about algorithmic inequities and unfairness.
